Cellular microscopy images for iiif experimentation
## Image Information
These are 2048x2048 16 bit gray scale TIF files produced by a digital microscope. 
The image acquisition is such that the cells in a single field of view  are imaged at different wavelengths to detect fluorescently labeled cellular markers. 
At the end the separate gray scale images need to be pseudo-colored and overlayed to create a single color micrograph.
